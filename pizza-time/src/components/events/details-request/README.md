To use the component:

simply pass the place_id to the component as props, it will place the place_id in the request object, and make the request. 

NO STYLING HAS BEEN APPLIED AND IT HAS VERY GENERIC DATA (AKA JUST THE PLACES NAME) if you need a certain type of data or want anything else added let me know and we can work through it together.
